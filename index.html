        <h1>about me</h1> 
        <h3>where i'm from</h3>
        <p>i am from the island of saipan in the commonwealth of the northern marianas islands, also known as the CNMI. we are a commonwealth of the United States, which is the same kind of territory as puerto rico. my home is nearly 6000 miles away from here in the middle of the pacific ocean, near southeast asia. i lived there all my life before moving here for college.</p>
        <h3>what i like to do</h3>
        <p>some of my hobbies include playing the guitar, graphic design, playing on my switch, and going running. i also really love exploring the city, grabbing boba and going shopping! </p>
        <h3>my aspirations</h3>
        <p>i am currently an intended CS major and although it's been tough for me and i do secretly envy those who make it look soooo easy, i really do believe it'll be worth it. i'm hoping to live here for a while after graduating before returning to Saipan and making an impact there. </p>
        <a id="work"></a>
        <h1>my work</h1> 
        <p>i'm a freshman so to be honest i don't have much professional work at all LOL. however, i will list a couple of my projects from high school because that's truly the closest thing i have.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>congressional app challenge: my senior year of high school, my teacher had us APCSP students enter the congressional app challenge. for my app, my partner and i decided to make an educational app that teaches users about the chamorro language, which is my culture's native language. this app was called "irensia," which is the chamorro word for inheritance, symbolizing our duty to inherit and maintain our language. we ended up placing second in the regional division.</li>

          <li>pacific mini games medals table: although i was not directly involved in coding this website, i assisted a web development firm in testing & troubleshooting the website they built to count medals for the 2022 pacific mini games, which was held on my home island this year.
